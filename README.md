This application was one of my numerous attempts to perfect my web developer resume. This application was made for a future employer to get to know my strengths and what I can provide to the developer world coming from a background of being an automotive technician. 

## The nights with React.js
This was a large project that was able to complete within a months time. It was difficult because this was my first project using tailwind. It was a bit of a crash course learning 
tailwind, since I was constantly comparing it to CSS. Once I got the hang of it I was able to properly create my application.
